In order to create this program there was a few goals I had to meet and a few challenges to solve. 

Goal 1- Succesfully connect program to webpage to download text.
 >How do I connect to the internet through my project? (Requires research)
 >How do I filter out unwanted characters (Need to look at Regex options)
 >How should I store it to properly prepare for the next step in the process?

Goal 2- Count words in string
 >What do I need to be able to count properly? (Most likely use a java object)
 >How do I check if a word has already occurred? (Object combined with some kind of loop?)

Goal 1 took some trail and error at first. The first section of the main code focus on creating a connection to the html page in order to download and store the text into 
a string. This brought up the problem of needing to filter out the symbols and weird codes brought in from the download. Looking up and researching Regex was necessary to
be successful in this part of the code. Having a large string is nice but I found it helpful to put each word into a section of an array as it is easier to work with.

Goal 2 was complicated compared to the first goal. I used two arrays, one storing the words from the text and 1 storing objects that acted as words with numbers attached
to them. This all came together but creating a new object in the array each time a new word appeared but if there was already a word with a corresponding object, I would 
instead up the counter of the object instead of creating a new one. This worked out well and in the end all I had to do was sort the array with objects and
pull the top 20.
